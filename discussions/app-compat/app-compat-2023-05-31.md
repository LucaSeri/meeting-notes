App-compat hackathon

TT: Redis uses `rename()`.
Inside the `rename()` implementation.

TT: I tested on 7.0.11.

CV: JDK: I did a detour and looked at the default builds from Oracle.

SJ: Is there a `getdents64` syscall on ARM.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Contact Cristi Banu about 9000L support for `rename()`.

TT: Test with Ubuntu / Debian Redis binary-compat packages.

Update it to a newer version.
Look for the `lib-redis` repo.
Use `make`-based approach.
