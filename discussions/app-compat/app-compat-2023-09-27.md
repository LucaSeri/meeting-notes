## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MS: I would use Dockerfile to grab the executables and the dynamic libraries.

MS: I would work on getting executables and components from Docker running on top of Unikraft.

SK: There would be step-wise items when using multi-process in bincompat mode.

Then we look into `vfork()` and `exec()`.

And then multiple address spaces.
