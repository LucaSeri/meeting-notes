## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

Nowadays there are 64bit Cortex-M CPUs.
That would require someone to work on MPU.

MP: My take on Unikraft and embedded is that nowadays, people want some guests in support roles, along Linux.
People would use RTOS (QNX - paid, FreeRTOS).

MP: On top of a hypervisor, you can leverage the hypervisor isolation features.

MP: You could come up with a use case with Unikraft on top of an embedded device with a hypervisor.
Using isolated unikernels.

MP: Another use case is IoT.
We can look into [OP-TEE](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/op-tee/) and [TF-A](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-a/).
Support for boards that deal with IoT.

Security is also important on the embedded world, Linaro support Secure Boot.

We can demonstrate our own SecureBoot chain with the latest Unikraft.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Start a HackMD document to collect potential tracks for baremetal / embedded virtualization.

Next meeting: Wednesday, August 23, 2023, 5pm CEST.
