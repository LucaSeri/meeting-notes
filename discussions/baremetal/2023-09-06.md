## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

RN: The first step would be to bring up the platform code.

RN: Then we want to look into the driver shim layer and into other projects where we can use drivers from.

RN: I will first look into the Xilinx Zinq board and see if it works.

Probably it makes sense to have someone first look into what it takes concretely to have Unikraft running on Cortex-M.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

Discussion on AArch64 / ARM64 naming

Dropping 32bit support

How to make difference between Cortex-M, Cortex-A, Cortex-R
