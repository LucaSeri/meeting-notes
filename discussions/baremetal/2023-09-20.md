## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

RN: I coudn't get it to build for the recent Unikraft version.

I managed to build it for 0.4, a modified version.
Now I wanted to test the board, to put Firmware on it.
They have an OOB (Out of Box) from Xilinx.
Then I want to see how to put the binary on the board.

I need to use JTAG.
I need to connect the board.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RN: Ask question on connecting to the board on the #baremetal channel.

RN: Ask Andreea about the bootloader.

RN: Look into the OOB package for bootloader information.

RD/RN: Decide 4 weeks from now whether we stick with this board or we mote to another.
