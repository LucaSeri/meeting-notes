## :dart: Agenda

- Driver shim support

## :closed_book: Discussions

RN: I got it to build on Unikraft staging.

RN: It's just trying to boot from a specified address and it's failing.

RN: I get output from uboot.

MP: Maybe you could use a `while (1)` to see if it gets to that point.

RN: I want to create a Linux image (`uImage`).

SM: What uboot command do you use?

RN: First I use FatLoad.
Then I used Go.

RN: This is the command I used: `fatload mmc 0:1 0x10001000 hello.bin`

SM: You should use the correct address for the ELF binary.
See here: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/plat/kvm/arm/link64.lds.S#L58

SM: Look into the data sheet and see where the RAM starts.

There is a general profile in QEMU, but probably not a general profile.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RN: Use the address as suggested by SM.
