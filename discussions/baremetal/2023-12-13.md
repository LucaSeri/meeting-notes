## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

RN: There is probably is a mis-configuration with the headers.

RN: I couldn't get a uBoot to work.
I got a serial connection to it.
I used a pre-compiled version of uBoot and that didn't work.

RN: I loaded the ELF in memory.

SM: What I would to is change the base address of the Unikraft image.
I would use QEMU first, and attach 

SM: This is to be able to make sure that uBoot and the Unikraft image work well together.
That will let you know if you are jumping to the right place.

SM: After this you can move out to the board and see what is happening.

RN: I get an uBoot console with some items missing.
Something breaks on uBoot.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RN: First see if what I compiled is correct at all, with respect to what uBoot expects.
