## :dart: Agenda

- Status Update

## :closed_book: Discussions

MP: 32bit support is deprecated.
My take on this matter is that we don't need be burden.

For ARM32 we can have a survey to see if there is a use case.

ARM released the latest cores of ARMv8 that don't support ARM32.

RN: Still trying to figure out how to make QEMU work.
I was trying to build a uBoot version that works.
For now I don't a have confirmation that it boots.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

Postpone any change that affect the Xen ARM64 work after it gets upstream.

RD: Do a survey in the community about ARM32 support.

RK: Confirm the use of ARM32 bit platforms.

RN: Try out uBoot with QEMU and see if it boots.
Ask for support on Discord.
