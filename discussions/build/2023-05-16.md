## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

SK: Help out the users to not bump into compiler-related issues for `aarch64`:

```
# set cross compile
ifeq ($(call qstrip,$(CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE)),)
ifneq ($(CONFIG_UK_ARCH),$(HOSTARCH))
    CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE := aarch64-linux-gnu-
    endif
endif
```

SK: This toolchain will not include any dependencies on `kraftkit` or anything.

AJ: Docker can provide an argument for different compilers.

RK: Get a binary and see if it works.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Assign 2 people in the community to use the custom GCC / QEMU Docker-based setup that's provided with `kraftkit`.
Provide them to Robert.

RD: [someone] Look into solving the emuTLS AArch64 issue with the custom GCC from `kraftkit`.

TODO: Provide GCC / QEMU as pre-built images in a archive.

TODO: Look into how cross-compilers are built: statically linked or not.
Aim to deviate as little as possible from the standard ARM cross-compile build.
