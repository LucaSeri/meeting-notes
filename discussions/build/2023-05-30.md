## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

We integrated GCOV freestanding information with GCC13.

There are multiple ways to export the GCOV information.

There are support scripts that depends on external libraries.

Coverage can be used for fuzzing.

SK: The question is for internal vs external.
For internal is how to handler it for clang.

SK: I'm wondering what's missing in nolibc in order to be able to build with GCOV.

SK: Even though it requires an external library, nolibc should provide all support.

SK: What happens in the clang case?

MP: I tried to build Unikraft with Clang and then I tried to get it to work for ARM.

MP: My problem was that I had to export some Clang with some part of GNU tools.

MS: The LLVM tools are kind of nice but not all there.

SK: Official support will be part of selecting the compiler, even in the cross-compiler case.

MP: When you cross-compile, you just export the variable with the pass to the cross-compile toolchain.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MS/Maria/Ștefan/RD: Share the way you are using Clang.

SK: Provide opinion on the Clang usage.
