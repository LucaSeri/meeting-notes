## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MK: rustc invokes the final linking step.

MK: In the support library I reply on the start symbol.

MK: In the build library, I created a static library.

MK:
- static library
- name of start symbol
- the 
- a post build-script

MK: Do we want to support an external linking step.

MR: With the linker scripts that we have, it's flexible.

MR: The script that we have now, we can remove and include other steps.

MSch/MR: We could create a collection of scripts and wrapper shell script.

MSch: We can generate the shell script.

MR: Do we generate the script everytime we build?

MSch: Yes, I think this is the best approach.

MK: This script wouldn't go into build.rs.

MSch: You need a nice mechanism to collect these scripts and that have a common format.
And build a pipeline of these.

MR: In short, we need to replace the internal linker script based steps with a wrapper scripts that can be called from external sources (such as Rust).

MSch: If `mkboot` disappears, we can replace it with something else.

MR: The scripts that converts the ELF64 to ELF32 for multiboot would also be required to be called externally.

MK: Linking script collection is not something I looked into.

MR: The entry point depends on the platform.

MSch: You can use `make printvars`.

MSch: I wonder whether we can do it such the final linker script.

MK: Having a way of retrieving the linker scripts.

MSch: It's similar to the entry point.
We can standardize where it's placed.
Or add a print variable that provides that.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MSch: Provide approach to update the build system to allow external environments to call the final linker steps.

RD: Ask SK to review the proposal.
