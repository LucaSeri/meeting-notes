## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MK: The goal is to port Rust application with Unikraft.
For applications, the Rust compiler wants to have the leading hand.

My first approach was based on the way we do it with RustyHermit.

However, there are post-processing steps that Unikraft does.

Marco proposed to have a collection of these post-processing steps that can be invoked from outside.

I repurposed these steps to use Unikraft scripts as the linker.

In this way, rustc tells the linker script to use object files and linker scripts to link the final image.
This works nicely until so far.

MK: SW, you had some comments of only using `LDFLAGS`.

The Linux kernel now uses `KCFLAGS` for kernel-only compiler flags.

Maybe we could use the same flags `UK_CFLAGS` or `UK_LDFLAGS`.

MK: I want to have an environment variable.

SK: Then let's do it this way.

MK: The base setup is working.
Now I want to get a higher level:
- replace `make` with `kraftkit`
- replace `rustc` with `cargo`
- replace nostd with std

SK: The only change we need is the option to pass different flags?
You have script part of the Rust language library.

SK: We need to be able to detect command line changes.

MK: At this point I have to manually clean.

MS: As a hack you can touch a file.

SK: Maybe we can split the build process in:
a) build everything for Unikraft
b) build the Rust parts

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MK: Put a sample output after the call.
