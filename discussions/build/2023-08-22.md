## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

SK: Probably some of the text processing takes some time.

MS: We should be able to pinpoint hot spots.

SK: We could store intermediary values in variables.

SK: We should start with the libraries that are failing when using `make -j` instead of `make prepare && make -j`.

SK: Probably libraries that have custom `prepare` rules should be fixed, but they may be prime candidates for the parallel builds issue.

SK: Fixdep places information in the dependency file.

SK: If we go for the `@args` proposal from Marco, we could use this.

SK: Switch to the `@args`-mode.

MS: You have the command line somewhere and you need to compare that fixdep.

MS: You could copy the file somewhere and then diff those files.

MS: You can use `file_uk_compare`.

SK: With the command file, I like less that we fork twice: once for bash and once for GCC.

MS: This is hapenning anyway, but we could use `exec`.

SK: We could get rid of a fork shell invocation.
We could remove at least the one we introduced.

RD/SK: We could introduce a debug option to dump the contents in a `.cmd` file.

SK: Very high priority is that whenever there is a flag change you would do the rebuild.
In short, we shouldn't do `make properclean`, `make` should just work.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD (create issue): Make take a few seconds even if there is nothing to build.

SJ: Applications / libraries that fail building when using `make -j`.

RD: Find someone who can quickly look into compile flag change detection.
