## :dart: Agenda

- Items for release 0.14.1

## Discussions

CI integration + GitHub

app catalog

fdtab, Firecraker network, ARM CCA, Xen AArch64, Go for AArch64, shutdown mechanism (Sergiu, Simon)

app-elfloader should have its own version

getting `Library.uk` would probably simplify things for us

We could decouple releases and that will provide the option to make releases more often and with shorter more readable messages.

## TODOs and Decisions

Work on getting items in for release 0.14.1.
