## Discussions

### Part of the Release

Xen on AArch64

app catalog

CI integration

VFS-core

shutdown feature

multiprocesssor spec

best effort CCA

Go ARM64

Gcov

random

docs

### CCA

I've been working on changes in the memory subsystem.
It was something we were required to do anyway.

I'm in the state of cleaning this up.

A goal would be to get is http reply to work.
If we have that, then we can show some potentially meaningful realms for SQLite or something like that as a confidential database.

Before that, it would be useful to demonstrate attestation.

### Next Release

discuss and agree on Xen support

update to newlib and pthread-embedded

CCA

DLang support

### Not Part of the Release

SM: Firecracker shutdown driver
- this requires proper ISA / PCI

Michalis: you can cut some corners

SM: All we would need is an ISA bus driver.

MP: I'm in general concerned about the technical debt from neglecting ARM.

It's good to work in a cross-architecture way.

I found the device tree node for shutdown.
It's GPIO.

## TODOs and Decisions

RD: Talk with Simon about Firecracker shutdown driver
