Aim to have more time and focus for OSS contributors starting from summer.

## TODOs and Decisions

RD: Prepare items for release 0.16.2: add small fixes PR, assign reviewers

RD: Prepare GSoC announcements and applications.
We focus on simpler project that can be handled by the overall community.
We use the bincompat / catalog guides / documentation as starting point for interested candidates *before* they start their application - to have a portfolio of contributions.

Everyone: Submit small fix PRs ASAP to be included in release 0.16.2.

RD + AJ: Prepare landing page for Zagreb hackathon.

RD + SK: Prepare slides for FOSDEM talks.
