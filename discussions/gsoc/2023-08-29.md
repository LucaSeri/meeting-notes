We want to see how they're behind.

RD/MP: Student-ready projects aligned with the timeline.
Student can be ready to handle the project.

RD: We want to be more selective projects.

MP: Some projects we can delegate, some we need to work on ourselves.

AJ: There are some items that are too important for the project / company.

AJ: A nice to have is a good description for a good GSoC project.

HL: There is a lot of time between project proposal and the actual start of work.

AJ: Leaning towards shorter projects may be easier.

### TODOs and Decisions

For future versions:

- Have project that are nice to have, but not critical.
- Consider own capacity of mentoring projects.
- Have some standard or simple items that would assess the capacity of participants before recruiting.
