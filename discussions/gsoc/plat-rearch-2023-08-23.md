### Agenda

Status updates

### Discussions

RM: The virtio PR is work in progress.

SK: Where are the macro definitions PR coming from?

MP: The priority is GIC.

MP: I will provide comments on the virtio PR.

MP: We need someone who work on memory randomization.

MP: Not sure if we are capable of refactoring changes.

### TODOs and Decisions

SK: Look into the 1023 driver subsystem PR.

We suspend the discussion at this point until we get the drivers in and the types PR and we resume in the future.
