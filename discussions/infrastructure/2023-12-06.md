## :dart: Agenda

- Summary of goals
- Initial tasks

## :closed_book: Discussions

### CI/CD

On the KraftKit's side, it can do whatever it needs to do.

Make runners on UPB infrastructure.

We have to run xl natively, before KraftKit has Xen support.

AJ: I imagine we would need to pipeline every library.
And we would want a set of tools to integrate that.

### Governance

RM: I looked into my notes.

RM: The implementation should have the users that are already defined.
I would use the GitHub API implementation as a model.

RM: Should we add a new directory?

AJ: First commit should be a directory named `config` that collects all config files.

RM: Start with two PRs:
- one collecting configuration files
- the other one is creating the config file for GitHub + Discord integration;
for now start with one file

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

Discuss about library pipelining after the 0.16 release.

RD+CC: During on the hackathon on Sunday, December 17, 2023 - work on UPB runners for native infrastructure.

RM: Create initial PRs on governance repository.
