## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

When a real error occurs, we want to know why.

AJ: Networking is now enabled.

AJ: You have to add the driver.
Drivers aren't yet listed.

AJ: `kraft ps`, `kraft ps --long` to show ports

AJ: I will commit / push networking support today.

AJ: We have `NetworkSpec`; we will then use `VolumeSpec`.
This is step 3.

AJ: First step is specifying the directory as a volume, and serialize it into initramfs.

AJ: 2nd step is better integration with ELF Loader.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Complete networking support.

AJ: Work on `app-elfloader` integration.
