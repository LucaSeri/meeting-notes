## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: Networking is in.

AJ: We will do a kraftkit demo next week.

AJ: 0.6 release will include bincompat support.

We want to do testing before the 0.6 release.

CC: The ability to push in the registry is now available.

AJ: There are plenty of items in `kraftkit` that can be improved.

ZL: I'm going to solve the error tracing.

AJ: There is a PR submitted.

Documentation is done via `pkg.go.dev` (https://pkg.go.dev/kraftkit.sh)

There is QAPI that's exposed by QEMU.

A program that parses this, could generate ProtoBuf, convert to Go and systematically invoke Q code.

It was someone from University of Texas.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Discuss with Alex about a potential diploma project: https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/issues/204
