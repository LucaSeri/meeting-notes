## :closed_book: Discussions

We've been thinking about app repositories.
There's many of them.

We want to have a central repository application where we would store configuration files for all applications.

CC: Fedora builds were broken, now it works.
There is an installation part for Linux.

CC: I'm investigating it now to see whether we can ditch containerd.

HB: I'm doing support for OCaml.

AJ: You have a Git repository and you want to commit via KraftKit.

HB: Right now, I have an idea on how to do it.

ZL: I did a PR for some of the use cases.
I will discuss about details regarding our ideas.

MdS: I created a PR, waiting for Alex's review.
Will discuss with Alex about the next steps.
