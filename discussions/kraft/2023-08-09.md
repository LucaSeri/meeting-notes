## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

RD: As I bumped into issues with C++ (due to library ordering).
Can I pack a build folder that was generated by the Makefile system?

AJ: The runtime directory is used for unikernel running information.

AJ: We need to improve / fix the runtime directory, to have it available for everyone, not to bump into the `/var/kraftkit/` issue.

AJ: There will a new release with work done during the past month.
The library ordering will not be part of the release.

AJ: Volume support is a big feature that we added.
A lot of bug fixes.
We want to have multi-platform images.
Work from Sahil.

AJ: From the last week, the GitHub action update is the major update.

RD: For Martin's `kraftld` PR, the program needs to be added to the user's `PATH`.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Provide feedback on the `kraftld` PR.

RD: Do testing using KraftKit.

AJ/CC: Prepare release of KraftKit.

We meed on two weeks from now, on Wednesday, August 23, 2023, 1pm CEST.
