## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: In the application `catalog` all applications build.

AJ: There's another PR that has to do with the serialization of the filesystem.

AJ: `-v` is to be used for 9pfs support.

AJ: `kraft run` has been overhauled.
`--initrd` is replaced with `--rootfs`.

AJ: We need to add support to determine if the kernel support 9pfs of initrd.

RD: Is there bandwidth to integrate `kraftld`?

AJ: There are two outstanding issue:

- part of the build
- have that file installed in the user's path

AJ: I can push the changes together with the script.

AJ: Documentation site is about 90% done.
It's more likely to be done closer to the end of next week.

AJ: The `--elfloader` is used when you use the ELF Loader.

AJ: If a Linux binary is passed, KraftKit should be smart enough to decide that it should be run using the binary compatibility layer / ELF Loader.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

TODO: Continue development of KraftKit.

AJ: Plan the integration of `kraftld`.
