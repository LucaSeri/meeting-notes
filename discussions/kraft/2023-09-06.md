## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: There are a lot of fixes that have been merged.

AJ: We will have a major release with breaking changes.

- The way in which you package OCI archives.
- The same image reference with multiple kernels, and you select which one you want.
- 0.5 -> 0.6 in `Kraftfile` or `kraft.yaml`: reference prebuilt unikernels and you can then just do `kraft run`
- Serialization of the root filesystem.

There are several integration with Docker in 0.7.

- Ability to build a root filesystem from a Dockerfile.

This 0.7 release will happen next week and we will also publish the `catalog` repo and automatically populate the registry.

My vision it to have a tab with the application catalog.

AJ: I'm publishing the documentation today.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Publish the documentation.

AJ: Do next release of KraftKit.
