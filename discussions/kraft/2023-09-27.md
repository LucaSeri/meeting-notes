## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

`kraft.ld` integration for KraftKit.

What Martin wants is a flag to `kraft build`.

This has been lingering because of that change.

AJ: The nice way to think about was that the Kraftfile was being built, but now it also defines how it's going to be run.

Without run items in Kraftfile, you would have to use `kraft run`.

AJ: It's been a simpler week.

CC: The periodic auto-release script is working.

AJ: The merge system is updated.
I wrote a tool.
It will be eventually added to GitHub.

CC: I've done fixes all around KraftKit.

AJ: The whole network subsystem doesn't work on Mac.

`docker-compose` is a feature to be added to KraftKit.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Work on having `kraftld` integration in Kraft.

RD: Use merge tool for new commits.
