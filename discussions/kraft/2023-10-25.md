- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

0.7 release, big update

You can now write the Kraftfile and use a pre-built unikernel.

There is a new spec of Kraftfile.

Documentation on the spec is available.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

The release should happen by Wednesday, November 1, 2023.

RD: Be back on Kraftkit running with Firecracker.

If config dependency don't work, it's a fault of the Kconfig system.

AJ/RD: Investigate Fircracker not working.

CC: Look into ARM64 output synchronization issue.

AJ: Look into Kraft LD after the 0.7 release of KraftKit.
