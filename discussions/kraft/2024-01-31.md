## :closed_book: Discussions

LS: There is a pretty big PR with 4 subcommands for `compose`: https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/pull/1024

LS: I've an issue with the SeaBIOS preamble.

AJ: We have a way to ignore that.

LS: I have the ZIP store included in the PR.

LS: It sorts of has all the functionality we want.

MdS: No updates from my side.

AJ: Improvements to `kraft run`.

A major change is embedding more information in the `Kraftfile`: memory, port mappings, probably other metadata information.

We can have two different README files: one for building and one for using.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Provide feedback on PR for `compose` command: https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/pull/1024

RD: Test Firecracker on KraftKit.
