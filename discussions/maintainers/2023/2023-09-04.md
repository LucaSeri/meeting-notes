### API

SK: Did you play a bit with it?

AJ: We would need a Doxygen to Markdown marker.
There are some converters we need to use.

AJ: Solution: https://github.com/sourcey/moxygen

### CI

We use two branches `staging` and `stable`.

`stable` becomes the default branch.

Process is:

- PR is submitted
- PR is checked by CI
- approved PR goes to `staging`
- PR goes through nightly build
- Once tests pass, PR goes into `stable`.
