## :dart: Agenda

* Updates to linuxu deprecation decision (are there any?)
* Next release plans
* Student projects (diploma, master, GSoC)
* FAQ docs
* Anything else

## :closed_book: Discussions

SK: Maybe move it out part of re arch.

SK: Debugging tooling is getting better on Xen and KVM.

### 0.16.3

- Small fixes / updates.
- Fully populated catalog.
- Archs all working - testing apps on bincompat, native x86_64, native ARM.
- ideally: this week, March 8, 2024 - no later than March 15, 2024

Questions:

- What is the trigger?
- What to test: all catalog apps.
- Where does it run?
- How does it work?

- Start a workflow on the unikraft repository that calls all application build actions in the catalog repository.

CC: The easiest is an action per action.
And a meta workflow running at midnight that sends and event on the core repository.

SK: For this iteration, only update the libraries that are currently used.

If both branches are the same, then nothing happen.

### 0.17

* signals

* device drivers (after plat re-arch).
* multi-app
* netlink
* vfscore re-arch
* plat re-arch
* CCA, SEV (Michalis?)
* newlib alignment
* shutdown for Xen, Firecracker, QEMU (simpler version)
* Xen PVH bincompat
* Remove ARM32 from the code
* synchronize memory subsystem (buddy allocator, paging)
* document use of VDSO, needs to be revisit because of changes from Sergiu on app-elfloader
* refactor PRs from Sergiu & others
* intermediary step for ISR-safe builds
* HW RNG (AlexA, Michalis)

### Later

* ARM64 bincompat
* shutdown with full ACPI support
* VMware
* RISC-V
* Hyper-V
* Static code analysis / CoverityScan
* MTE on Musl
* synchronizing scheduler data structures
* final step for ISR-safe builds
* VMI integration

### Student Projects

* ARM64 bincompat
* Parallel build for Unikraft - with Make
* Add CFI directives for ARM
  * Can be used in functions such as those that use stacks
  * Maybe we could just use DWARF bytecode instead (master project)
* MTE on Musl (Ștefan)
* DLang as native build
* Rust VMM (reliant on plat re-arch)
* Intel Cloud Hypervisor (reliant on plat re-arch)
* Native language ports: Node, Ruby, Dotnet (?), Java (?), Perl, PHP
* Tooling (Alex, Cezar, Antoine about project ideas)
* virtio-rng (Michalis)
* R-Pi support
* GPIO driver

#### Future Projects

* device drivers (after plat re-arch).

#### Need to Get Status

* virtio-vsock
* virtiofs (reliant on the vfscore re-arch from Andrei)

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Create a GitHub project 0.16.3.

CC: Look into this week: nightly builds.
