## Discussions

AJ: I need to test runu again for Jackson.

RD: Look into micropython.

Jackson: Optimized micro-service.
KataContainers and micro-vms.
I looked into NanoVMS and Unikraft.
My use case is to try to get a service running in Kubernetes.

RD: The catalog-for-maintainers will not have items in the registry.
It's targeted for maintainers, testers.

AJ: It's good you're using KraftKit in staging.
If you pushed the image with an older format, you should remove and upstream it again.

The unpacking happens by KraftKit.
The last release of KraftKit 0.6.7.

Jackson: It seems the error messages are not so intuitive.

AJ: I really recommend using: `--log-type basic --log`.

## TODOs and Decisions

RD: Merge PRs that are already approved.

For kraft-ld there is a change required in order to unblock this.
