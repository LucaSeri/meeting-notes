### Agenda

Status updates

### Discussions

We have smaller ones: RTC and tap that can be taken care of.

RM: There are some stale PRs that Rareș can work on after drivers.

MP: We should skip the double underscore.

SK: We are not fully libc-compliant as we have the `__sz` data types.

These types used for printing are not provided by GCC.
They are defined in `inttypes.h`.

Print formatting types depend on the size of the types.

If we decide to fully drop the idea, we should do an investigate whether GCC provides the print formatting items.

MP: These are part of C99.

SK: We should prefer using the GCC data types.

MP: Someone needs to look at the standard to see if we can have a correlation.

SK: I'm thinking of starting with `lcpu` and then move into `ukvmem`.

SM: I've created some structure and ideas on ukboot and ukinit.

SK: Let's have small digestible pieces to integrate.

SM: If we have a foundation done, 1/3 of the code would be out of the RISC V or other PRs.

SK: How do you define a driver framework?

SM: Generic interface to interact with firmware, DT an ACPI.

SM: I would also add an I/O APIC part.

SM: Also, I would redesign PCI.

SM: With an unified IRQ system, that would work better.

SK: Moving needs to happen first.

### TODOs and Decisions

RM: Port smaller RTC and tap drivers.
