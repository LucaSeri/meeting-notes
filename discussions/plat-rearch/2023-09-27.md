### Agenda

Status updates

### Discussions

MP: We moved the interrupt controller from plat.

MP: In plat/kvm we had irq.c.
These are now part of the generic API.

MR: Did you develop a unified API so that x86 and GIC are used the same way.

MP: Sort of, we define ops.
This means that we have some ops that are common and that we have some framework.
Someone needs to create common ops.
There are stils some operations that are not one-on-one.

MR: Is there a PR for this?

MP: Yes, it's a PR.
It's pretty close to merging.

MP: This type of work is very hard to delegate.
You have to be very familiar with the system.
And then questions emerge.

MP: The next big two items are lcpu and paging.

MP: I think they need to be done internally.

SK: I guess we should start with `lcpu`.

MR: What is the reasoning for starting with `lcpu`?
Is that because it's more primitive?

MR: Paging may be easier, because it's less code.

For registers, it goes under `arch/`.

For drivers, it goes under `drivers/arch/`.

### TODOs and Decisions

RD: Discuss plat re-arch priorities in the next maintainers meeting.
