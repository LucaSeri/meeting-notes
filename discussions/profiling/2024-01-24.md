## :dart: Agenda

- VMI

## :closed_book: Discussions

### VMI

AV: Introspect the stack of the application using VMI.

AV: I used helloworld app spinner to have a live program to inspect.

MS: You don't need `lib-unwind` for this.

AV: The addresses I got for the stack are OK.

AV: I often reach `hlt`.

AV: I used a custom KVM VMI kernel.

AV: It was easy to write the program, about 15 minutes.

AV: I'm using the `_pa()` interface to read from physical addresses.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AV: Get the first unwind to work.
Use `addr2line` for starters.
Use the most simple thing.

AV: Investigate the translation from virtual addresses to physical addresses and the VMI API.
