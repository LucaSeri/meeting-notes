## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

FA: I don't have any issues compiling `ukrust`.
I managed to create a dummy Rust function and call it from `ukboot`.
It's a simple custom library that I created.

FA: I did a small change in `ukrust`.

MK: Once the static library setup is done, I would then be able to create a Unikraft crate.

MK: The `unikraft-rs-abi` will be available outside Unikraft.

MK: There are some projects that provide direct access to OS API: https://tokio.rs/

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

FA: Create a PR on `ukrust`.

FA: Implement `ukargparse` as a next step.

FA: Provide replicating test instructions on Discord channel.

RD: Ask Simon for input or Marco's proposal for static library build.

Discuss static library build at our next build system meeting on Tuesday, June 27, 2023.

RD: Ping Vlad on the status of `unikraft-rs-abi`.
