## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MK: The only required item is the `KRAFTLD` support.

MS: We could call a script to make this happen.

### Next Steps

MS: We could add conditionals to enable binary system call handlers.

MK: It would be cool to move to direct Unikraft API in the Rust.

MS: This means making it more compatible with nolibc.
