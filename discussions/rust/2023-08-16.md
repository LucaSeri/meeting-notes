## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MK: The only required item is the `kraftld` support.

MK: Currently, there is no documentation on building with Unikraft Rust.
This is will be done after `kraftld` support.

MK: Rust `tiny-http` works on Rust, all applications should.

MK: The `app-helloworld-rust` repository should be renamed;
it's not a helloworld application written in Rust.

### Next Steps

RD: Ping Alex regarding the integration of `kraftld`.
