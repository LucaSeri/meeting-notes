## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

Șerban: I was using Unikraft 0.12.

SS: Software randomization.

AA: I'm scoping the openssl repository.

SM: We need to just call a random seed and then call the relocator.

SM: We could use a random address (page-aligned) and pass that to the relocator, that will apply all relocator address.
It also goes through all `ukplat` memory-regions.

SM: For x86, there is an assembly relocator for 32 bits / multiboot-part.
And then a 64-bit relocator.
They could work any time.

This page-sized text area.

MP: Once you get UEFI to work, you can start on a proper solution.

SM: Doesn't he need to boot on UEFI?

SM: The image must masquerade as a PE.

VB: I believe Firecraker is also expecting a Linux image.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Ask for info on Dang-O presented at Amsterdam hackaton, for potential to upstream: https://download.vusec.net/papers/dangzero_ccs22.pdf

SS: Look into QEMU issue.

AA: Make OpenSSL work with RDRAND.

AA: Test OpenSSL + libsodium on Aarch64.

AA: Look into Michalis's comment on `lib-sodium`: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-libsodium/pull/8#pullrequestreview-1412458111

VB: Work on KASAN support.
