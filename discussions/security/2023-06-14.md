## :closed_book: Discussions

SS: There is an issue with permissions in the linker script.

XZ: I put my progress in the thread.
Now I can run app-helloworld.

XZ: Some of the virtio can be moved if you can use other devices.

HL: I can help with the virtio work.

MP: Because we don't have a way to do this easily, we should make some progress on plat re-arch, before Xingjian can work on implementing the CCA library.
And then work on making the rest of the implementation clean.

MP: It's important to know how the implementation work.
