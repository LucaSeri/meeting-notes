AA: I managed to test OpenSSL and it works properly.
I wrote a simple helloworld.

HL: For security reasons, you cannot include that.
How you do it, depends on your decision.

HL: You're saying that instead of encrypting or decrypting on the fly.

HL: Adding a copy is the easy way of solving a problem.

MP/XZ: We agreed on the priorizing of API, before moving into other items.

### Page Table Protection

MP: If you enable paging, you need to set up the page tables for the heap to work.

MP: Regarding the effectiveness of randomizing the page table, it may be part of a defense-in-depth protection, because it's a weak defensive mechanism.

Sealing is unmapping.
