## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

RV: The internal structures of threads cannot use common scheduling mechanisms.
We cannot use scheduler-invoking scheduler mechanisms.

Internal logging + SMP-safe logging

First duplicate the cooperative scheduler and make it work on multiple CPUs.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Discuss with Adina about ISR-safe project.

RD: Create a summary of the SMP-related projects.
Use HackMD for this.

MP / SK / MR: Discuss and provide plan for mmio support.

RD: Get state of vsock support.
