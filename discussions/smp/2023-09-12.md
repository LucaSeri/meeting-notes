## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

RV: The PRs were split into two levels.
I need to check it with the 0.14 release.

RV: The efficient way is to use rwlocks.
But we cannot do that, as the page fault itself causes ukvmem.

The page fault handler requires access 

RV: The implementation gets simpler with spinlocks.

The problem is the ukvmem vs the page faults.

There is the idea of doing page fault-free.

SK:

1. `uksched` internal data structures need synchronization.

1. Run one scheduler per CPU.
   A scheduler queue for each CPU.

1. Then migrate threads to different CPU.
   And implement different scheduling algorithms

MS: We have a read-write lock update.

SJ: If you could assign some tasks.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RV: (this week) Check to see the high-level PRs still works.
Then reask reviewers.

RV: Use spinlocks to synchronize for the `ukmem`.
