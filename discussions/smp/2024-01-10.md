## :dart: Agenda

- Status update

## :closed_book: Discussions

There was an issue with the NX bit.
I need to test if it works.

I worked using the approach that we discussed with Sergiu before the holidays.
I used the same tests I used before and they work.

RV: I still haven't received an opinion regarding the placement of a lock on the page table.

We've had an old discussion: https://discord.com/channels/762976922531528725/883603425076584448/1115189650965930044

This PR will be updated: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/801

RV: Work on updating the bbudy PR: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/801
