## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: I'm still stuck in the error.
Before calling this function, it doesn't work any more.

PV: I'm commenting out the allocations and I get the error message.

MR: How these fields might be used 

MR: The allocation may have some implicit effect, such as changing the allocation.

### VMware

PU: Something related to rebase work.
There was a commit where I added size, metadata, info of memory page.

PU: Wireshark couldn't do anything.

PU: I added a new field that changed from an 8-byte alignment to a 16-byte alignment.

PU: Allocator region requires 16 bytes alignment (for the `e1000` driver).

PU: I rebased on 0.12.
I'm now on 0.13.

PU: Regarding Nginx, I'm trying to test it.
We don't have a filesystem.

MR: You can write your own main and write out the files that you need.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Talk to Teo about Hyper-V.

RD: Arrange for a device to run VMware ESXi.

PU: Use memalign for VMware.
