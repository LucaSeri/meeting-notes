## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: Stuck in the sample part.

PV: I started allocating different sizes.
It's not working except one page size.
<= 2048 doesn't work

If I allocate `calloc` with `palloc`.

### VMware

PU: I didn't do the item list.
But I got `vmxnet3` going.

PU: I'm porting items from DPDK.

PU: When I'm doing printing, I get some issues.

PU: I'm using Unikraft 0.13 for this.

### vsock

AT: I submitted a compiler flag that I found when working on vsock.

AT: The `virtio-vsock` work is submitted.

AT: `app-httpreply` crashes after some packets are being sent.

AT: Next step would be `virtio-vsock` on PCI.

AT: PCI support is only available on QEMU.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AT: Make it work with LWIP / Unikraft 0.13.
Test pr708-wasp.

AT: Get past the current crash.

PU: Fix issue for VMware and Unikraft 0.13.

RD: Take a look on the virtio-vsock PR.

RD: Discuss with Marc, Michalis, Simon about external repositories for `plat-vmware` and `plat-hyperv`.

PV: Use a pre-allocated buffer and look into the next issue.

TT: Make setup work with Hyper-V.
