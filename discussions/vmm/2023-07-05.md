## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: I used a static allocation that got me away from the issue.

PV: I get an LWIP error after fixing this.

### VMware

PU: I didn't have time to work.
Will do it after next Wednesday.

PU: I did a comparison to Ubuntu on ESXi.
Nginx behaves similarly.
Median download speed is identical;
it seems weird, I will need to redo.
They both use `vmxnet3`.

PU: I used `taskset` but it is worse.

TODO items:

* `vmxnet` doesn't work if I disable printing before initialization.
* Split implementation of `vmxnet` / `e1000`.
* I will probably create 4 PRs
  * one on PCI, there are some issues with register values and logic, on Unikraft core
  * another one on `plat-vmware`
  * one for the `e1000` driver
  * one for the `vmxnet3` driver

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

PV: Add issue on `plat-hyperv` on memory issue: https://github.com/unikraft/plat-hyperv

PV: Investigate LWIP issue further.

RD: Get status from Teo Tiron.

PU/RD: Work on blog post

RD: Discuss in plat re-arch meeting about placement of `e1000` and `vmxnet3`

All: Discuss about introducing a Hyper-V / VMware tutorial as part of the USoC'23 hackathon on Saturday, July 15, 2023.
