## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: I solved the Hyper-V issue.

PV: At this point, full networking doesn't work.

PV: I hit a blocking point, a deadlock.
It's a wait queue inside my driver.
vmbus is FreeBSD, networking driver is DPDK.

PV: I commented out some RX filter code.

PV: The moment I solve the blocking issue, I need to pass the messages higher up the stack.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

PV: Update the Hyper-V documentation.

PV: Look into in the networking deadlock problem.

RD: Investigate PhD projects Unikraft-related.
