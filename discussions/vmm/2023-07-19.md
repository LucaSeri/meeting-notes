## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### VMware

PU: I created the VMware documentation.

PU: Managed to solve the inconsistent issue related to PCI communication.
PU: I used a write barrier, respectively a read before after each PCI write / read operation.

PU: Up until now, I worked on an modified version of KVM, nothing to update `plat-vmware`.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

PU: test to see the overhead of the barriers in the code.

3 PRs:

* Solving the PCI problems, generally available.
  * Send a message on the #vmm channel.
* Create VMware-core support PR.
* Create PR for vmxnet support.
* Create PR for e1000.

RD: Push for VMware tutorial walkthrough.

RD: Assign someone to work on volume / block device support.
