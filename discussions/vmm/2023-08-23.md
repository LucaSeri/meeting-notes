## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: I restarted work.

PV: I replicated the situation with helloworld and with httpreply, once I removed the debug issues.
I fixed the problem.
Now it works.

PV: There is a workaround around the problem with memory, we got passed it, but the problem is not properly fixed.

PV: I will work next on the RX part.

### VMware

PU: I created a first commit for VMware support.
These are PCI items required for `vmxnet3`, but may be required for others as well.
Some of the values were erroneous.

Current VMware tutorial: https://docs.google.com/document/d/189y5zncps37ghng7QS86foFoYoFK_q63RE0vpn0kCg0/edit?usp=sharing

PU: There should be another PCI PR, related for `vmxnet3`.

PU: Last time I added some memory barriers at the initialization phase.

PU: I would like to add further benchmarks to see if the memory barriers don't affect anything.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Think of someone (Rareș?) to follow the Vmware tutorial: https://docs.google.com/document/d/189y5zncps37ghng7QS86foFoYoFK_q63RE0vpn0kCg0/edit?usp=sharing
And to review Paul's PRs.

PU: Re-create VMware benchmarks.

RD: Kick-off discussion regarding PhD for PU.

PV: Work on the receive part.

PV: Add issues on static buffer workaround and ticks-to-seconds conversion in the `plat-hyperv` repo: https://github.com/unikraft/plat-hyperv/issues

We meet once every two weeks.
We meet next on Wednesday, September 6, 2023, 8:30am CEST.
