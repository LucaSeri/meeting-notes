## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: I took the BSD driver for VMI bus.
I obtained channels.

PV: I went to networking.
I used DPDK.
The DPDK stack was used in Unikraft, so it made sense to use that.

PV: TX worked.
And now I was working on RX.

PV: The only documentation is the DPDK and FreeBSD.
And a presentation at BSDCon.

PV: When I sending a query request, there was no response from the hypervisor.
When I used static buffers 

PV: Issues:

* lack of documentation
* DPDK uses polling, FreeBSD uses interrupts

MariaP: I bumped into the same issue that Paul bumped into.
I got the work from Vlad and I am now continuing that.

SM: It makes sense to have dynamic allocation issues.
This is because the allocator may be used in interrupt context.

PV: Would be useful to know the RNDIS and NDIS protocols.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AM: Look into repositories for slides related the Hyper-V, RNDIS, NDIS.

MariaP: Try to run the http-reply example.

PV: Work on RX part of the implementation.
